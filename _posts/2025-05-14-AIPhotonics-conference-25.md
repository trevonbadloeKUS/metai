The conference was held alongside the OVC Expo at Wuhan Optics Valley... with 2 floors of optics companies showing off their latest devices!

The conference was really interesting, with some talks were given in Chinese, with real-time translation using AI (however it is still a little way away from being perfect..!)

Trevon's talk was given inside the convention hall, with professors, students, optics companies, and some general public in attendance...
The event was also live streamed, with over 19,000 concurrent viewers online!
