Trevon spent 10 days at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), China, hosted by Profs. Xuefeng Liu and Jichuan Xiong from the School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronics Technology, as well as a couple of days visiting Suzhou City University in Suzhou...

Professors from around the world were invited to give talks and hold discussions on research directions and progress in current topics such as nano-optics, biophotonics, and photoacoustics, with speakers from China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, the UK, Pakistan, Germany, Italy, and Hungary!

The weather was really crazy... Over 30 degrees at 8am, and near 40 degrees through the day...;;;;

One of Trevon's favourite Chinese dishes was served at dinner—La Zi Ji (Sichuan Mala Chicken, 辣子鸡)...
However, the "chicken" was actually frog...haaa

After spending some time in Nanjing, we visited Suzhou, a beautiful city...

We also participated in the International Symposium on Metamaterials and Nanophotonics (ISMN2025), which featured amazing talks from speakers from around the world, including Prof. Sailing He from the College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, China, and my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Junsuk Rho from POSTECH.

It was a great experience, with lots of interesting scientific (and some not so scientific...) discussions. Finally getting to meet some professors in person after only being able to connect online was amazing. Meeting new researchers with fascinating specialties and ideas, as well as seeing some familiar faces again, was also wonderful!

I am especially thankful to Qasim (ITU, Pakistan) and Jichuan (NJUST, China) for their organization and invitation~ ^^ 谢谢
