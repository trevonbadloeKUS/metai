Trevon visited Glasgow for **research exchange** and gave a **seminar to faculty and graduate students**.
Thanks to [Dr Hasan Abbas](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/hasanabbas/) for hosting and arranging everything everything!

With the name of the department being the 'James Watt School of Engineering', it is obvious how important the school is...
Not only James Watt, but we can also see Lord Kelvins house on campus

He joined the university in 1834, when he was 10 years old!
