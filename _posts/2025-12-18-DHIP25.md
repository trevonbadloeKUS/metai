It was a great honour and pleasure to be invited to the conference and spend time getting to know researchers in the areas of digital holography and information photonics, from quantum to cm-scale optics!

The tour of the island took us to some amazing places, with great views, glass bottom boats, and sake...

and concluded at a local hall (without WiFi ㅎㅎ)

It was a great opportunity to meet new researchers from Japan and Korea, and spend time with the KUS photonics team!

I also got the chance to chair a session of the conference (thanks to the professors who kept on time without must intervention!!) and be a judge for the poster presentation awards~!
