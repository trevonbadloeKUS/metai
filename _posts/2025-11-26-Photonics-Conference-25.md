There was interest in our research from other attendees, so Minsung got to discuss his ongoing research...

Minhyeok and Changhyun actively participated in the poster session with discussion with researchers in various fields...
However, travel from Sejong to Pyeongchang is not easy without a car...so someone should be brave and drive next time ㅎㅎㅎ

Compared to last year, there was only a little bit of snow (/rain(?))...so we didn't get to see the winter wonderland...what a shame...
