The A3 Metamaterials Forum 2025 international conference was held at KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, bringing leading researchers in the field of metamaterials from the 3 countries of East Asia, Korea, Japan, and China!

Trevon was honoured to be invited to give a talk, but unfortunately caught COVID19 and was unable to join in person. Luckily the organisers were able to arrange for the talk to be given online, to the offline audience... (Thank you so much!)

All of the students from the lab were able to attend and (hopefully...) learned a lot and experienced new topics in the field of metamaterials and nanophotonics~
