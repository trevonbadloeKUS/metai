Trevon was **invited** to give a talk at the Optical Society of Korea, Photonics Conference 2024 at Phoenix Park, Pyeongchang. The conference dates coincided with the **first snow** of the year! It was really beautiful...but a little dangerous too~

Trevon also had the honour of his first experience **chairing** a session for 광소자3. (the session was kept *mostly* on time...)
It was great experience to meet so many amazing researchers in related fields and see the groundbreaking work that is being undertaken in photonics at universities in Korea!
