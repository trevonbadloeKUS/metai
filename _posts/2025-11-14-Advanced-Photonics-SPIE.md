It is always a pleasure to visit Hong Kong... especially when it is 20 degrees, rather than 0 degrees back home in Korea...

The Hong Kong Polytechnic University was amazing to look around, a lovely clean and modern campus~ The conference coincided with the graudation day of lots of students...it was great to see all the new graduates throwing their hats and celebrating ^^

The nanophotonics and quantum optics session at the conference provided a chance to listen to leaders in their fields of metaphotonics, time crystals, and quantum optics to name a few! Thanks to everyone who I got to meet and spend time with, and to everyone who joined my talk... even though it was on the last day ^^
