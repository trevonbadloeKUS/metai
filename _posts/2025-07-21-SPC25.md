Trevon was invited to be a co-chair of the nanophotonics session and give a talk at the first Sustainable Photonics Conference at the Hangzhou International Innovation Institute of Beihang University!

It was a great honour to be a co-chair alongside Professors Joel Yang (Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore), Olivier Martin (EPFL, Switzerland), and Feng Luo (Nankai University, China).

Planetary talks from Profs Sir David Payne and Adrian Podoleanu kicked off the conference with excellent talks on optical fibres and OCT.

It was a really big honour to chair the keynote talk of Prof Olivier Martin, after his inspiring talk at a workshop in Daejeon in 2017 was one of the first to see as a fresh PhD student!

Trevon was also a recipient of an 'early career award', which was given at the ceremony by Sir David Payne!

The trip rounded off with a short (but very long) walk around West Lake in Hangzhou. It was over 35 degrees, so very very sweaty, but extremely beautiful!
See you next time, Hangzhou~!
